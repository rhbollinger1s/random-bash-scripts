# random-bash-scripts

A place for me to put my spare bash scripts... some are untested...

To use one on your system, follow the steps: \
1): Copy the file/script you want  \
2): Navagate to the directory you have it in \
e.g. cd ~/downloads \
3): Make the file executable \
chmod +x scriptname.sh \
4): run the file \
./scriptname.sh
